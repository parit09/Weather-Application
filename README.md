# Weather-Application
 A project on weather monitoring application. By python programming and front-end using tkinter.

 The Weather Monitoring App is a Python-based application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for a specified location. The app leverages the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and uses JSON to handle the data fetched from a weather API. This project is a practical demonstration of combining Python with Tkinter for GUI development and JSON for data manipulation.

Features
->Real-time Weather Data: Get the latest weather information for any location.
->User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive GUI built using Tkinter.
->JSON Integration: Efficient data handling using JSON format.
->Error Handling: Proper error messages for invalid inputs or API errors.
Technologies Used
->Python: The core programming language for the application.
->Tkinter: Used for building the graphical user interface.
->JSON: Used for parsing and handling the weather data.
->Weather API: An external API to fetch real-time weather data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
